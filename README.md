# DndChar

This project is supposed to be a responsive app for D&D character sheets, mostly so I don't have to struggle using excel for my inventory.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.8, and is using Bootstrap 4 when I get around to styling.

## Setup

Run `npm i` to install node modules, this assumes you have installed npm.
Project is created with npm version 6.1.0
Run `npm -v` to discover your npm version, today.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running tests
